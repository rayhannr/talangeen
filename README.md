There is one pain point I often encounter when I travel with friends. Usually, one of us will pay for everyone for one transaction. So different transaction, possibly different payer. At the end of the day, we write down who paid how much for whom for what transaction and manually calculate who should pay this first payer for how much.

I build this app to allow us to only write down the members and the transactions. All the calculations are done automatically by this app.

This project is built using React + Typescript + Vite. To run it in your local machine, just

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Open `localhost:3000` in your browser
